**Goodreads Recommender System**
This repository contains code for building and evaluating recommender systems using the Goodreads dataset. The Goodreads dataset comprises information about books, including titles, authors, ratings, reviews, and genres. The goal of this project is to develop recommendation algorithms that can suggest books to users based on their preferences and past interactions with books.

**Key Features:**
Popularity-based Recommender: Recommends popular books based on factors such as rating count, review count, and average rating.
Content-based Recommender: Recommends books similar to a given book based on their textual features, such as genre and votes.
Genre Based Recommendation System: Recommends with highest ratings and views from each genre.
Award Based Recommendation System: Recommends award winning bestsellers that have highest ratings.

**Files:**
goodreads.py: Python script containing all the code for building and evaluating the recommender system.
Book Recommend: Directory containing the Goodreads dataset and any other relevant data files.

**Usage:**
Setup: Clone the repository to your local machine.
Data Preprocessing: Ensure that the Goodreads dataset is available in the data/ directory.
Run Scripts: Execute the Python scripts for different recommender systems to generate recommendations.
Evaluation: Use the evaluation script to assess the accuracy of the recommendations produced by each recommender system.
